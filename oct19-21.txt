Sorry for the delay I was unable to do works in 19 and 20 since i had a function.

On 21 trying the unit test chapter in task 3

in the first reading I didnt undestood much but after working out and 

doing as they said it was better to understand even though their explanation seems to be a little boaring

Some of the concepts in unit testing was hard to understand after i got it correctly i will goto next chapter
