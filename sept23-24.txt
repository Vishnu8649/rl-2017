These two days completely dedicated for interpreter building

Completed almost all basic functionalities of lispy

The Evaluation part was a bit trickier it took too much time to figure out the eval function but somehow could figureout it

The parsing and tokenizing was easier considering to the Evaluation part

I will push the program to the git repo tomorrow after checking some test casesand little bit of commending and other modifications.

Managed to complete without much difficulties
