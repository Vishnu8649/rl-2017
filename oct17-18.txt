Started edx course 

At starting there were some videos about coding competitions

and the questions corresponding to them were successfully completed

then the week1 problem set started it was really good questions and could finish first 3 questions faster

but the next question was bit trickier because of its wordings so took some time to find actual question

and there are some errors trying to solve them

task 3 was started and worked out till 9.3
