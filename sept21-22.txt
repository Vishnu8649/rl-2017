Gone through almost all required basic concepts in javascript

Read data structures regular expression modules etc

Some was confusing anyway started interpreter lis.js

Started with tokenizing it was simple and found the solution faster

The next one was parsing, parsing was bit trickier so took some time to find the solution 

Looking forward for the other steps tomorrow
