On 28 I tried the second part of the prgram 

It took so much time to figureout how to do it anyway i got some ideas from net

and on 29 i just left one day leave for my self

and on 30th i managed to implement the searched contents to the first part of my interpreter

There was some errors and took time to figure out since i am new to javascript

But learnt so much of it during this project

After some modifications i will push the updated program to github 

tomorrow onwards i will catch up with the class videos of Pramod sir
