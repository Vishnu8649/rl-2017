Completed the first part of the lisp interpreter with the commenting

The second par seemednto be difficult it took a day for figure out how it can be implemented and found a solution.

Trying to implement that but keeps showing some logical error 

trying to figureout the error it creates new environment and the parameters gets maped to the arguments something wrong with evaluation
